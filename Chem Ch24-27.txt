Chapter 24 -- Simple molecular substances with non-octet structures and shapes of simple molecules

1. What is the Valence Shell Electron Repulsion Theory (VSEPR)?

Ans: Electron pairs in the outermost shell of the central atom tend to stay as far as possible to minimize electrostatic repulsions.

2. Describe the basic principles to predict the shape of a simple molecule with suitable examples.

Ans: The shape of a simple molecule is governed by the repulsion between the electron pairs in the outermost shell of the central atom.
     Electron pairs try to get as far apart from one another as possible to minimize electronic repulsion.

3. What is the meaning of 'octet rule'?

Ans: The 'octet rule' states that all atoms tend to achieve the stable electronic arrangement of a noble gas when they form chemical bonds by transferring or sharing e-.

4. Why does <compound> (e.g. NH3) adopt a __ (e.g. trigonal pyramidal) shape?/ Predict the shape of <compound> and explain. [COMMON] [2 marks]

Ans: The central atom <atom> in <compound> has <int> bonds pair(s) and <int> lone pair(s) in its outermost shells. [1]
     In order to minimize the repulsion between electron pairs, <compound> adopt a <shape>. 

5*. Why does XeF3 not exist? Ans: Xe in XeF3 has 11 valence electrons, compounds/ions with odd number of valence electrons are usually unstable, and therefore does not exist.

6. Account for the fact that both CH4 and NH3 have shapes based on the tetrahedron. [2 marks]

Ans: The C atom in CH4 and the N atom in NH3 have 4 electron pairs [1], and according to the VSEPR Theory, the 4 e- pairs will be arranged in a tetrahedral shape. [1]

7. BF3 reacts with NH3 to form an adduct. Account for such formation and draw the three-dimensional shape. [2 marks]

Ans: B in BF3 is electron deficient. [1] N in NH3 donates its lone pair of e- to B to form a dative bond. [1]

8. Explain why a lone pair of e- exerts greater repelling effect than a bond pair of e-.

Ans: Lone pair belongs to the centre atom and bond pair is shared among two atoms. Therefore lone pairs are nearer to the central atom than the bond pairs, which exert a greater electrostatic repulsion.

Common misconceptions/other tips/points to note:
1. Period 3 elements can form more than 4 single bonds because the 3rd electron shell can hold 18 e- at maximum (they can expand their octets).
2. Lone pair of e- exerts greater repelling effect than a bond pair of e-

Chapter 25 -- Polarity of bond and molecule

1. Define electronegativity. (Ans: Electronegativity of an atom represents the power of that atom to attract bonding electrons in a covalent bond.)

2a) Define a non-polar covalent bond. (Ans: It is a covalent bond where there is equal sharing of electrons between the two bonded atoms.)
2b) Define a polar covalent bond. (Ans: It is a covalent bond where there is unequal sharing of electrons between the two bonded atoms.)

3. Which 2 factors does polarity depend on? (Ans: Polarity of individual bonds, shape of the molecule)

4. What is a polar molecule? (Ans: A polar molecule is a molecule in which the polarities of polar bond cannot cancel each other.)

5. Explain why the bond angle between <bond A> in <compound A> (e.g. NH3) is greater than <bond B> in <compound B> (e.g. PH3)? [COMMON]

Ans: -Both compounds have a <shape> (e.g. trigonal pyramidal shape) [1]
     -*<central atom A> is more electronegative than <central atom B>. The bonded e- are more shifted to the <central atom A> in <compound A> [1]
     -This results in a stronger repulsion between the bond pairs in <compound A> and <compound B>, and thus a larger bond angle in <compound A> [1]

6. What is bond dipole moment/bond polarity? (Ans: It is a measure of the extent of polarization of the bond. The more polar a bond, the larger its dipole moment.)

7a) Explain why <compound> (e.g. CCl4) is non-polar. (2 marks) [COMMON]

Ans: -CCl4 has a tetrahedral structure, which is highly SYMMETRICAL. [1]
     -Hence, the bond polarity of four C-Cl bonds cancel out each other. [1]

7b) Explain why <compound> (e.g. H2O) is polar. (1 mark) [COMMON]

Ans: -H2O has a bent structure. THe bond polarity of the two O-H bonds for H2O cannot cancel out each other.

8. Consider a deflection experiment. 
a) How can the results distinguish polar and non-polar molecules? Explain briefly.
 Ans: The +ve or -ve end of the polar molecules will be attracted to the charged rod and the jet of liquid is deflected towards the rod.

b) If a -ve charged rod is used instead of a +ve charged rod, will there be any changes to the results?
 Ans: No. The polar molecules will orientate themselves with the positive ends attracted by -ve charged rod.

Common misconceptions/other tips/points to note:
1. Polarity increases with electronegativity difference.
2. Trend of electronegativity across period (no need to explain):
   No. of protons increases across period, e- added in same shell -->
   Stronger attraction between nucleus and outermost e- --> e- are more pulled to the nucleus 
   --> atomic size decreases across a period --> larger attraction between the atom and the bonded e-
3. Trend of electronegativity down group (no need to explain):
   Each successive element has one more filled e- shell than the previous element in the same group -->
   Smaller attraction between nucleus and outermost e- --> e- are more pulled to the nucleus 
   --> atomic size increases down a group --> smaller attraction between the atom and the bonded e-

Chapter 26 -- Intermolecular forces

1. What are the two main types of intermolecular forces? Define both types of forces.

Ans: -Van der Waals forces are the attractive forces that exist between all molecules.
     -Hydrogen bonds are the attractive forces between a H atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom AND the lone pair of e- on ANOTHER highly electronegative atom.

2. Explain the formation of Van der Waals forces.

Ans: e- in molecule are in constant motion --> e- distribution may be uneven --> side with more e- form partial -ve charge (vice versa)
     --> affects e- distribution in other molecules and induces similar separation of charges on them --> attraction

3. What are the factors affecting the strength of Van der Waals forces?

4. Determine which compound has a higher boiling point. (3- 5 marks) [COMMON] 
a) Different strength of Van der Waals forces -- Ans formula:
(1) a > b
(2) Case 1: Different molecular size --> a > b [1]
    Case 2*: Different molecular shape --> shape of a is more spread-out/linear while b is more compact, allows greater surface contact area between b than a [1]      
    Case 3**: Polar and non-polar molecules --> due to presence of polar bonds that cannot cancel out each other [1]
     **: Explain why a is polar, b is non-polar if the question is 2+ marks
Note: Can only compare molecules with one difference (aka one indepedent variable), mention the difference if necesary
(e.g. same molecular formula, same functional group, both are polar/non-polar)
(3) Strength of Van der Waals forces of a > b [1]

b) Different strength of hydrogen bonds
(1) a > b 
(2) Case 1: Both are polar molecules, one of them forms H-bonds 
     --> <element A> is highly electronegative and has a very small size. The <bond> bond is strongly polarized. H-bonds are formed between <compound A> molecules.
     --> <element B> is less electronegative and larger than <element A> atom. The intermolecular forces in <compound B> are van der Waals forces.
    Case 2: Both are polar and form H-bond
     --> Intermolecular attraction in <compound A> and in <compound B> is mainly H-bond
     i) Different no. of H-bond formed on average
     --> compare number of H-bond formed on average for each type of molecule
     ii) Same no. of H-bond formed on average, same bond polarity
     --> more extensive hydrogen bonds are formed between the molecules = stronger intermolecular forces (even though only 1 hydrogen bond ca be formed on average for both molecules)
     e.g. CH3CH2NHCH3 vs CH3CH2CH2NH2, both have lone pair of e- from N, but there are more H atoms bonded to the N atom for the latter
     e.g. H2O2 vs H2O: due to presence of one more O atom in H2O2, it forms more extensive H-bonds between molecules
     iii) Same no. of H-bond formed on average, different bond polarity
     --> <element A> is more electronegative than <element B>, <compound A> molecules form stronger H-bonds than <compound B> molecules
(3) Since intermolecular forces between <compound A> molecules are stronger than <compound B> molecules, b.p.: a > b (state explicitly which type of force for each compound respectively)

Note: If both vdw and H-bond exist, say it's PREDOMINANTLY held together by H-bonds

5. Explain why water has an abnormally high boiling point compared to other Group VI hydrides. [comparison]

Ans: -O is small in size and highly electronegative, O-H bond is strongly polarized. Hydrogen bonds exist between water molecules.
     -Other Group VI elements are not small and electronegative enough to form hydrogen bonds. Only van der waals forces exist between the molecules 
     -Since Van der Waals forces are weaker than hydrogen bonds, water has the highest b.p. among the group VI hydrides

6. Explain why HF has a higher b.p. than NH3? (application of 4b Case 2iii)

Ans: Fluorine has a higher electronegativity. H-F bond has a higher electronegativity difference than N-H bond. H-F bond is more polarized than N-H bond.
     H-F forms stronger hydrogen bonds between molecules

7. What is viscosity? (Ans: It refers to the resistance of a liquid to flow)

8. What is the relationship between surface tension, viscosity with the strength of intermolecular forces between molecules?

9. What happens to the viscosity of a liquid if the temperature is increased?

Ans: When temperature increases, heat is supplied to break some of the intermolecular forces, which decreases the viscosity.

10. Arrange CH3CH2OH, H2O, and H2SO4 in an order of increasing viscosity.

Ans: CH3CH2OH (1 H-bond) < H2O (2 H-bonds) < H2SO4 (2 H-bonds with more O atoms --> more extensive H-bonds)

11. Why are many sugars soluble in water?

Ans: They have many hydroxyl groups and can form a large amount of intermolecular H-bonds with water molecules.

12. Compare the a) surface tension b) viscosity c) solubility of two substances.

Ans: a)/b) <compound a> has higher intermolecular forces between its molecules than <compound b> (state the type of intermolecular forces and compare their strengthse.g. H-bond)

13. Given the evaporation rate of two liquids, compare their strengths of intermolecular forces.

Ans: The slower the evaporation rate, the stronger the intermolecular forces.
     (Need to gain energy from surroundings to overcome the intermolecular forces that hold molecules together)

Common misconceptions/other tips/points to note:
1. Types of dipoles and formation of dipole-dpole interaction is out of scope.
2. Higher volatility = lower boiling point
3. H-bond can only occur between a small, very electronegative atom and a H atom bonded to a ~ (Cl is highly electronegative but it is large in size)
4. Properties directly related to strength of intermolecular forces include b.p./m.p., surface tension, viscosity and solubility
5. For alkanols/alcohols, those with relatively short non-polar hydrocarbon chains are completely misicible with water 
   (Solubility decreases as length of non-polar hydrocarbon chain increases)
6. Maximum number of hydrogen bonds does not necessarily equal to the number of hydrogen bonds formed on AVERAGE
7. Arrangement is different from shape (e.g. NH3: tetrahedral arrangement but trigonal pyramidal shape)
8. Hydrogen bond exception: C-H bond in trichloromethane can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules because the presence of 3 electronegative Cl atoms 
                            makes the H carry a high partial positive charge
9. For hydrocarbon compounds with hydroxl group(s), the molecule is non-polar if there are more than 4 carbon atoms in the carbon chain.
10. For the explanation of soluble hydroxyl compounds, the small number of carbon atoms must be mentioned in addition to the formation of H-bonds.

Chapter 27 -- Structure and properties of ice

1. Explain why the density of ice is less than that of water. (3 marks)

Ans: -The intermolecular forces between ice and water is both H-bond
     -The directional character of the H-bond makes the water molecules arrange tetrahedrally to form an open cage structure
     -When ice melts, the structure collapses. Molecules can be packed more closely together in liquid water than ice

2. What is a crystal? 

Ans: It is a solid material in which the constituent atoms are arranged in an orderly repeating pattern extending throughout the material.

3. Why is the O--H distance shorter than O - - - H distance? (Ans: Covalent bond is stronger than H-bond and holds particles more closely together.)

4. What are fullerenes? (Ans: Molecules composed entirely of carbon atoms, in the form of hollow spheres)

5. Compare the hardness of diamond with graphite (Recall chapter 9).

Ans: -Diamond > graphite
     -In diamond, each C is covalently bodned to four other Cs, forming a 3D giant network. RELATIVE MOTION OF THE ATOMS IS RESTRICTED.
     -In graphite, only weak van der waals forces exist between adjacent layers, these weak forces make the layers of a graphite crystal easy to slide past each other.

6. Explain why an atmosphere of helium was used to produce buckminsterfullerene. (out sy)

Ans: Helium is inert so that carbon atoms in buckminsterfullerene would not burn in air to form CO2.

7**. The H--O--H bond angle in ice is about 109 degrees but about 105 degrees in gaseous H2O. Explain why there is such difference. [HARD]

Ans: In each water molecule in H2O(g), there are two lone pairs of electrons and two bond pairs of electrons around the central oxygen atom. The
     four electron pairs take up a tetrahedral arrangement such that they experience the least repulsion. [1]
     The two lone pairs exert a greater repulsive force than the two bond pairs. As a result, the H-O-H bond angle in H2O(g) is squeezed to a
     value of about 105. [1]
     In the structure of ice, the tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules allows the formation of maximum number of hydrogen bonds. Hence,
     the H-O-H bond angle in ice is about 109 degrees.

Common misconceptions/other tips/points to note:
1. Pure buckminsterfullerene (C60) does not conduct electricity, but it can pick up metal atoms within the spaces between molecules in the molecular crystal
