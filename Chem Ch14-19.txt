Chapter 15 -- Concentration of solutions

1. What is the unit of concentration and molarity?

2. State the definition of concnetration.

3. Calculations questions
a) Basic types (e.g. finding no. of moles of solute with given molarity, M1V1 = M2V2)
b) Involves chemical equations (e.g. includes mole ratio of atoms and compounds)
c) Advanced types
    i) find molarity of acid with given density of acid and mass percentage of acid (need to let 100cm3 of acid)
    ii) from i) find the volume of acid needed to dilute a certain molarity of solution (check q5)

4. Why are commonly used solutions often purchased or prepared in concentration form?

5. Describe the purpose and process of dilution.

Common mistakes/misconceptions, tips:
1. Remember molarity = no. of moles of SOLUTE / volume of SOLUTION 
2. Always check if cm3 or dm3 is used
3. Do more practice questions on textbook
4. Remember to include the correct unit for long question calculations (e.g. molar mass = g mol^-1)
5. In dilution, volume of solution is always equal to volume of water plus volume of another liquid solution (e.g. ethanol) even if they have different densities.
    (provided that density is given) (form 2nd term test 1 MC Q1)

Chapter 16 -- Indicators and phenolphthalein

1. According to the principle of self-ionisation of water, why does water not conduct electricity even though it has mobile ions?

Answer: The self-ionisation of water is relatively rare and only a small fraction of molecules ionizes to form mobile ions in one time.
        The low concentration of ions resulting from self-ionization is insufficient to facilitate the flow of electric current.

2. What does a pH value represent?

3. State the purpose of a pH scale. (Ans: It is used to measure the degree of acidity or alkalinity of a solution)

4a) What is an indicator? (Ans: It is a substance which gives different colours in acidic and alkaline solutions)
4b) State three types of common acid-base indicators found in the laboratory and their respective colours at different pH levels.

5. What are the 2 usages of buffer solution in pH sensors?

Answer: (1) To provides a stable environment for the pH sensor/maintain a constant pH and allows more accurate detection of H+ (2) For callibration* 
*(By immersing the sensor in the buffer solution, it establishes a baseline reading and allows for accurate pH measurement of other unknown solutions.)

6a) State the advantages of using a pH meter rather than indicator solutions.

Answer: Easy to use,  quick to obtain accurate readings, can measure solutions of intense colour

6b) State the advatanges of using a  data logger with a pH sensor.

Answer: can be used in remote/dangerous situations, can be carried out 24/7, more accurate (X human error), frequent time intervals for collecting data etc.

7. A sample of conc. hydrochloric acid contains 35% by mass of HCl in the solution The density of the acid is 1.19g cm^-3. Find:        (from 2nd term test 1)
    a) The molarity of 1500cm^3 of the acid. b) Volume of conc. hydrochloric acid and water required to make 50cm^3 of 1M hydrochloric acid from the above conc. acid.

Common mistakes/misconceptions, tips, extra info:
1. [H+][OH-] = 10^-14
2. pH value of an acid can be lower than 0 (e.g. 10M of HCl). However, note that there is a maximum molarity of each type of acid. (e.g. HCl: 12.1M)
3. The colour of indicators (e.g. methyl orange) shown at different pH levels also depend on its concentration. (slight variations)
4. The pH shown by universal indicators can only be an integer if the colour scale only consists of integers.
    (e.g. if it lies between pH 1 and pH 2 we cannot say the pH is 1.5, instead just compare which is closer)
5. Buffer solutions can have different pH (e.g. pH4: acetic acid-sodium acetate buffer, pH7: phosphate buffer, pH10: borate buffer)

Chapter 17 -- Strength of acids and alkalis

1. State the definition of strength and concentration.

2. State the difference between strong/weak acids/alkalis.

3. Give a few examples of strong/weak acids/alkalis.

4a) Suggest 2 physical methods and 1 chemical method to distinguish the strength between two acids with the same molarity.

-pH, electrical conductivity
-add magnesium and compare the rate of gas bubbles evolved per unit time

4b) Suggest another chemical method for distinguishing the strength between two alkalis.

-compare moles of salt formed in neutralization between HCl and 2 different alkalis (mass cannot be compared because different salts have different relative atomic masses)
-compare the heat evolved in neutralization reaction (higher temperature change, stronger alkali)

5. Write the two step reaction of sulphric acid and sodium hydroxide.

6. List a method of neutralizing acidic soil. (from 2nd term test 1)

7. Provided with magnesium carbonate, outline an experiemtnt to show that sulphuric acid is a stronger acid than sulphurous acid. (from ch16-17 homework)

8. Compare rate of reactions in the two test tubes containing 2 different acids with same pH and same volume of sodium carbonate solution.

Answer: Rate of reaction is the same. The 2 solutions have the same concentratoin of H+ (aq) because they have the same pH.

Common mistakes/misconceptions:
1. When calculating the pH of an acid with -log[H+(aq)], always check if the acid is a STRONG/WEAK acid. 
    -If it is a weak acid, the calculated pH must be lower than that of the actual pH.
    (e.g. 1.0M of sulphurous acid does not produce 2.0M of H+ because it is a weak acid which only ionizes slightly in water)
    -When molarity of acid with given pH, remember to explain that the acid used is a strong acid, which ionizes completely to give the destinated moles of H+(aq)
2. When outlining experiments, write all controlled, dependent and independent variables invovled. 
    (e.g. solutions of same volume, molar concentration, solids of same mass and surface area, compare rate/vigour of reactions/evolution of colourless gas bubbles)
3. When differentiating between the strength of two acids, the steps for explanations are:
    a) <acid> shows a higher rate of <reaction>
    b) <acid> is a strong acid while <acid> is a weak acid
    c) For the same molar concentration, <strong acid> has a higher concentration of H+ (aq) to react with <reactant> compared with <weak acid>
4. pH determines the concentration of hydrogen ions in an acid. With a fixed concentration, the strength of different acids does not affect its pH.

9a) To obtain a solution of CuSO4 (aq), someone suggests that excess H2SO4 (aq) instead of CuO (s) can be used. Comment on the statement.
9b) Why is excess CuO (s) needed in the reaction?

10a) In the preparation of zinc sulphate, why can't zinc hydroxide and sulphuric acid be used? (Answer: Zinc hydroxide is not commonly found in the lab as a reagent.)
10b) How can we determine if the reaction has ended in adding zinc metal with sulphuric acid? (Answer: No colourless gas bubbles/zinc does not dissolve)

11. What is the purpose of washing the crystals? Why must distilled water instead of tap water be used?

Answer: It is to wash away the solution from the crystals and replace it with distilled water. Distilled water will not deposit impurities on the crystals.

12. Draw the set-up and list out the procedures for a) preparation of zinc sulphate crystals b) preparation of sodium chloride

13. Why can't calcium and nitric acid be used to obtain calcium nitrate?

Answer: Calcium reacts with water in the nitric acid to form hydrogen gas and calcium hydroxide, so pure calcium nitrate solution cannot be obtained after filtration.

14. How can we remove methyl orange indicator in the titration setup? (adsorption by activated charcoal, warmed, filtered)

15. In preparing insoluble salts, why is the method of adding acid to insoluble base/insoluble carbonate unsatisfactory? Give an example.

2a) Define standard solution.
2b) Define primary standard and give a few examples.
2c) What properties does the primary standard have?
2d) Is NaOH a primary standard? Why or why not? (No, because it absorbs CO2 and moisture in the air so it is difficult to meausre its weight.)

2f) Hence list out of procedures of the method mentioned in e).

03. Name a few hygroscopic substances. (Ans: NaOH/KOH, conc. H2SO4, methanol/ethanol, sugar, wood, NaCl/CaCl2/MgCl2/ZnCl2)

Common misconceptions/mistakes, tips:
1. Do a lot of calculations for this chapter
2. Deliquescent = substance that tends to change to liquid state 
3. Difference between 'Deliquescent' and 'hygroscopic':
   -Deliquescent substances are substances that dissolve in water to form a liquid. This is due to the absorption of water molecules by the solid. 
   -Hygroscopic substances are substances that attract water molecules from the air. This is due to the presence of hydrophilic groups on the surface of the solid.
