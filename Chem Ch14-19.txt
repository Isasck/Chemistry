Book 2A -- Acids and Bases

Chapter 14 -- Introduction to acids and alkalis

1. Name the acids present in a) citrus fruits b) soft drinks c) vitamin C d**) acid rain 

2. Name the definition and properties of acids.

Ans: 
-An acid is a molecular compound which forms hydrogen ions as the only cations when dissolved in water.
-Acid are electrolytes (mobile ions are present)
-Most acids have a sour taste
-They turn moist blue litmus paper red
-acid + metal --> metal salt + hydrogen     (for metals higher than copper in the metal reactivity series)
-acid + carboante --> salt + water + carbon dioxide       (effervescence occurs)
-acid + hydrogencarbonate --> salt + water + carbon dioxide
-acid + metal oxide/hydroxide --> salt + water (neutralization)

3. Name the definition and properties of alkalis

-Alkali is a substance which neutralize acids and is water-soluble (including slightly soluble)
-Alkalis are electrolytes
-They feel slippery
-Most alkalis have a bitter taste
-They turn moist red litmus paper blue
-alkali + acid --> salt + water (neutralization)
-alkali + carbon dioxide --> carbonate + water
-alkali + ammonium compound --> salt + ammonia + water
-alkali + metal salt --> metal hydroxides + metal compound

4. What is the definition of salt.

Ans: A compound formed by replacing hydrogen ion or ammonium ion in acid with metal ion.

5a) Describe the process for testing carbon dioxide.
5b) What happens when excess carbon dioxide is added to limewater. Write down the equations involved.

6. Why must acid be in aqueous state in order for it to show its acidic properties? (ionization)

Ans: When acid crystals dissolve in water, the molecules ionize to give hydrogen ions H+ (aq). All acidic properties are due to the presence of hydrogen ions.

7. Why does pure sulphric acid and nitric acid not show any acidic properties.

8. By using an equation, explain how baking powder makes cake spongy.

Ans: 2NaHCO3 --> Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O, carbon dioxide produced creates air spaces when it leaves the food which makes cake spongy

10. Explan how fizzy drink tablets work and how powder effervesce.

11. What is the basicity of acid?

12. Suggest some common types of bases and their usage in daily life if any.

13. Why does soil turn acidic?

Ans: 
-Acid rain contains pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxides which dissolve in water to form acids.
-Products formed by the decomposition of plants by microorgranisms are acidic

14. Name the properties of ammonia. (Ans: pungent smell, very volatile, water-soluble, less dense than air)

15. Name the colour of precipitate formed when different metal salts react with alkali.

16a) Design an experiment to test the reaction between alkali and an ammonium compound and to collect ammonia.
16b) Why do we lift the test tube in the above set-up suggested?

17. Which of the metal hydroxides redissolve in a) excess sodium hydroxide b) excess ammonia? Explain why.

18. Suggest 2 methods to distinguish between NaHCO3 (aq) and Na2CO3 (aq).

Ans:
Method 1: Add calcium chloride. Only white precipitate is formed in a solution containing Na2CO3.
Method 2: Add acid to both solutions. NaHCO3 absorbs heat whereas Na2CO3 releases heat.

19. Write down the chemical equation for the reaction between metal salt and ammonia. (e.g. FeCl2)

20. What is the difference between ionization and dissociation.

21. State the properties of concentrated HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Explain why should be done if concentrated acid touches our skin.

HCl: colourless corrosive liquid that gives out white fumes in air
HNO3: turns yellow on storage due to presence of dissolved nitrogen dioxide formed from decomposition of some of the acid, oxidizing and very corrosive, decomposes under light
H2SO4: colourless oily liquid, has dehydrating and oxidizing property
Safety: Wash the affected area with plenty of water then with very dilute sodium hydrogencarbonate solution

22. State the properties of concentrated alkalis. Explain why should be done if concentrated alkali touches our skin.

NaOH, KOH: very corosive, attack the skin readily and stain it yellow or even black
Safety: place the affected area under slowly running cold water

23. Suggest some safety precautions when handling concentrated acids and alkalis.

24. Describe the process of the following experiments:
a) copper + concentrated nitric acid
b) sugar (sucrose) + concentrated sulphric acid

25. Explain how to prepare limewater in a laboratory with an experiment.

26. Explain how to distinguish between 3 solutions containing zinc ions, magnesium ions, and lead (II) ions respectively.

27. Explain why NaOH (aq) and NH3 (aq) cannot be used to neutralize soil.
    -NaOH (aq) is corrosive in nature, while NH3 (aq) is highly soluble in water and highly volatile. 
    -When applied to the soil, a significant amount of ammonia can be lost through evaporation before it has a chance to effectively neutralize the soil acidity.
    -The high solubility can potentially lead to the leaching of ammonia, so it is easily removed by the soil water

Common misconceptions/ other tips:
1. All group I metals, compoounds consisting of nitric ions or hydrogencarbonate ions are soluble in water
2. During ionization, the covalent bonds of acids are broken. (new charged particles formed)
3. Hydrogen ion combines with water molecules to form hydronium ion. (cannot exist alone in aqueous solution)
4. Most acids ionize while most alkalis dissociate in water. However, ammonia ionizes slightly to give ammonium and hydroxide ions. 
5. NH4OH does not exist as an ionic compound
6. H2SO4 has a dehyrating property = removes hydrogen and oxygen in the ratio 2:1 from the substance (drying agent: removes moisture)
    (e.g. glucose + conc. H2SO4 --> 6H2O + 6C) (black solid is formed)
7. Not all acids have hydrogen atoms as its constitutent particles
8. Ammonia gas is colourless and can be seen
9. Chlorine gas can react with NaOH to form NaClO, NaCl and H2O (remove OH- ions)
10. Remember to check if the acid is in aqeuous state or solid state 
11a) Basicity of citric acid is 3
11b) In organic acids, look for acid groups (COOH) to determine which hydrogen atom is ionizable (e.g. HO-C is not ionizable)

2. Always check if cm3 or dm3 is used
3. Do more practice questions on textbook
4. Remember to include the correct unit for long question calculations (e.g. molar mass = g mol^-1)
5. In dilution, volume of solution is always equal to volume of water plus volume of another liquid solution (e.g. ethanol) even if they have different densities.
    (provided that density is given) (form 2nd term test 1 MC Q1)

Chapter 16 -- Indicators and phenolphthalein

1. According to the principle of self-ionisation of water, why does water not conduct electricity even though it has mobile ions?

Answer: The self-ionisation of water is relatively rare and only a small fraction of molecules ionizes to form mobile ions in one time.
        The low concentration of ions resulting from self-ionization is insufficient to facilitate the flow of electric current.

2. What does a pH value represent?

3. State the purpose of a pH scale. (Ans: It is used to measure the degree of acidity or alkalinity of a solution)

4a) What is an indicator? (Ans: It is a substance which gives different colours in acidic and alkaline solutions)
4b) State three types of common acid-base indicators found in the laboratory and their respective colours at different pH levels.

5. What are the 2 usages of buffer solution in pH sensors?

Answer: (1) To provides a stable environment for the pH sensor/maintain a constant pH and allows more accurate detection of H+ (2) For callibration* 
*(By immersing the sensor in the buffer solution, it establishes a baseline reading and allows for accurate pH measurement of other unknown solutions.)

6a) State the advantages of using a pH meter rather than indicator solutions.

Answer: Easy to use, quick to obtain accurate readings, can measure solutions of intense colour

6b) State the advatanges of using a data logger with a pH sensor.

Answer: can be used in remote/dangerous situations, can be carried out 24/7, more accurate (X human error), frequent time intervals for collecting data etc.

7. A sample of conc. hydrochloric acid contains 35% by mass of HCl in the solution The density of the acid is 1.19g cm^-3. Find:        (from 2nd term test 1)
    a) The molarity of 1500cm^3 of the acid. b) Volume of conc. hydrochloric acid and water required to make 50cm^3 of 1M hydrochloric acid from the above conc. acid.

Common mistakes/misconceptions, tips, extra info:
1. [H+][OH-] = 10^-14
2. pH value of an acid can be lower than 0 (e.g. 10M of HCl). However, note that there is a maximum molarity of each type of acid. (e.g. HCl: 12.1M)
3. The colour of indicators (e.g. methyl orange) shown at different pH levels also depend on its concentration. (slight variations)
4. The pH shown by universal indicators can only be an integer if the colour scale only consists of integers.
    (e.g. if it lies between pH 1 and pH 2 we cannot say the pH is 1.5, instead just compare which is closer)
5. Buffer solutions can have different pH (e.g. pH4: acetic acid-sodium acetate buffer, pH7: phosphate buffer, pH10: borate buffer)

Chapter 17 -- Strength of acids and alkalis

1. State the definition of strength and concentration.

2. State the difference between strong/weak acids/alkalis.

3. Give a few examples of strong/weak acids/alkalis.

4a) Suggest 2 physical methods and 1 chemical method to distinguish the strength between two acids with the same molarity.

-add magnesium and compare the rate of gas bubbles evolved per unit time

4b) Suggest another chemical method for distinguishing the strength between two alkalis.

-compare the heat evolved in neutralization reaction (higher temperature change, stronger alkali)

5. Write the two step reaction of sulphric acid and sodium hydroxide.

6. List a method of neutralizing acidic soil. (from 2nd term test 1)

7. Provided with magnesium carbonate, outline an experiemtnt to show that sulphuric acid is a stronger acid than sulphurous acid. (from ch16-17 homework)

8. Compare rate of reactions in the two test tubes containing 2 different acids with same pH and same volume of sodium carbonate solution.

Answer: Rate of reaction is the same. The 2 solutions have the same concentration of H+ (aq) because they have the same pH.

Common mistakes/misconceptions:
1. When calculating the pH of an acid with -log[H+(aq)], always check if the acid is a STRONG/WEAK acid. 
    -If it is a weak acid, the calculated pH must be lower than that of the actual pH.
    (e.g. 1.0M of sulphurous acid does not produce 2.0M of H+ because it is a weak acid which only ionizes slightly in water)
    -When molarity of acid with given pH, remember to explain that the acid used is a strong acid, which ionizes completely to give the destinated moles of H+(aq)
2. When outlining experiments, write all controlled, dependent and independent variables invovled. 
    (e.g. solutions of same volume, molar concentration, solids of same mass and surface area, compare rate/vigour of reactions/evolution of colourless gas bubbles)
3. When differentiating between the strength of two acids, the steps for explanations are:
    a) <acid> shows a higher rate of <reaction>
    b) <acid> is a strong acid while <acid> is a weak acid
    c) For the same molar concentration, <strong acid> has a higher concentration of H+ (aq) to react with <reactant> compared with <weak acid>
4. pH determines the concentration of hydrogen ions in an acid. With a fixed concentration, the strength of different acids does not affect its pH.

9a) To obtain a solution of CuSO4 (aq), someone suggests that excess H2SO4 (aq) instead of CuO (s) can be used. Comment on the statement.
9b) Why is excess CuO (s) needed in the reaction?

10a) In the preparation of zinc sulphate, why can't zinc hydroxide and sulphuric acid be used? (Answer: Zinc hydroxide is not commonly found in the lab as a reagent.)
10b) How can we determine if the reaction  has ended in adding zinc metal with sulphuric acid? (Answer: No colourless gas bubbles/zinc does not dissolve)

11. What is the purpose of washing the crystals? Why must distilled water instead of tap water be used?

Answer: It is to wash away the solution from the crystals and replace it with distilled water. Distilled water will not deposit impurities on the crystals.

12. Draw the set-up and list out the procedures for a) preparation of zinc sulphate crystals b) preparation of sodium chloride

13. Why can't calcium and nitric acid be used to obtain calcium nitrate?

Answer: Calcium reacts with water in the nitric acid to form hydrogen gas and calcium hydroxide, so pure calcium nitrate solution cannot be obtained after filtration.

14. How can we remove methyl orange indicator in the titration setup? (adsorption by activated charcoal, warmed, filtered)

Common misconceptions/mistakes, tips:
1. Do a lot of calculations for this chapter
2. Deliquescent = substance that tends to change to liquid state 
3. Difference between 'Deliquescent' and 'hygroscopic':
   -Deliquescent substances are substances that dissolve in water to form a liquid. This is due to the absorption of water molecules by the solid. 
   -Hygroscopic substances are substances that attract water molecules from the air. This is due to the presence of hydrophilic groups on the surface of the solid.
4. Memorise examples of acidic salts and alkaline salts.
5. Remember to state the volume of pipette when mentioning i (e.g. 25cm3 pipette)
