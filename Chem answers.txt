Chapter 9

1. Chemical bond refers to the electrostatic attraction that holds particles together.
   Ionic bond refers to the strong, non-directional electrostatic force between oppositely charged ions.
   Covalent bond refers to the strong, directoinal electrostatic force between shared electrons and the bonded nuclei.
   Metallic bond refers to the non-directoinal electrostatic force between delocalized electrons and metal ions.
   Empirical formula shows the simplest whole number ratio of atoms or ions present in a compound.

2. The nitrogen and hydrogen atoms in the ammonium ion are held by covalent bonds. The ammonium ion and chloride ion are held by ionic bonds.

3. Ammonium chloride has a giant ionic structure. The ammonium ion and chloride ion are held by strong ionic bonds. Much energy
   is required to separate the ions.

4. Diamond is hard because the cabron atoms are bonded by strong covalent bond in a giant covalent structure. It is not easy to separate the atoms.

5. Sodium chloride does not conduct electricity in solid state because the ions are not mobile. The ions become mobile when sodium chloride
   is molten or in aqueous solution because the ions turn mobile. 
   Diamond does not conduct electricity because there are no mobile ions or delocalized electrons.

6. The attractive forces between sodium ion and chloride ion is much stronger than the attractive forces between molecules in non-aqueous solvents,
   so the weak attractive forces between the molecules cannot overcome the strong attractive forces between ions, and new attraction forces cannot 
   be formed.

7. Cations and anions are held together by strong ionic bond. When a force is exerted, relative movements of ions bring ions of the same charge close
   together, thus resulting in repulsion.

8. The atomic size of caesium is larger than sodium. More chloride ions surround one caesium ion as a result.

9. Allotropes are two or more forms of the same element in which the atoms and molecules are arranged in different ways.

10. 

11. Diamond can be used for jewellery and glasscutter. Graphite can be sued as a lubricating oil in high temperatures or pencil lead.

12. Graphite is soft because the layers of carbon atoms are only held by weak Van der Waals' forces, which means the layers readily slide over each other.

13. Electric current is a flow of charged particles.

14. In copper metal, the atoms are closely packed to form a giant metallic structure. Each atom loses its outermost shell electron to form cation.
    A metallic bond is formed between positive metal ions and delocalized electrons in the structure.

15. When metal is heated, the delocalized electrons get more energy and move faster, which collide with neighbouring electrons more frequently. 
    Heat is transferred in these collisions.

16. Metal have high densities because the metal ions are packed closely together.

17. When a force is exerted on the metal, the layers of positively charged metal ions slide over each other readily. Non-directional metallic bonds still hold 
    the metal ions together. New metallic bonds are re-formed and the metal takes on a new shape.

18. 

19. The energy required to break lots of strong covalent bonds between atoms in a giant covalent structure is more than that to break strong ionic bonds betwee 
    ions in a giant ionic structure.

Chapter 10

1. Iron can be used for transport, construction and magnets because it is magnetic, cheap, malleable and ductile, hard and strong.
   Copper can be used for electrical wires because its electrical conductivity is excellent, and it is corrosion resistant and ductile.
   Aluminium can be used as overhead wire cabels because it electrical conductivity is very good, and it is less dense and expensive than copper.
   Gold can be used as a shield for heat because it has excellent reflective quality.
   Mercury is used in thermometers because it expands on heating, is liquid at room temperautre, and does not wet walls of tubes.

2. Most metals are found as compounds on Earth because they are too reactive to exist on their own. They react with other elements to form ores.

3. Salt, limestone, magnesite, bauxite, zinc blende, haematite, magnetite, copper pyrite, galena, cinnbar, argenite

4. The earlier the discovery of a metal, the easier the extraction method.

5. Galena (lead (II) sulphide) reacts with oxygen to form lead (II) oxide, which is extracted as lead metal by burning the oxide with carbon

6. It acts as a reducing agent.

7. Carbon monoxide or hydrogen gas.

8. The temperature of the Bunsen Burner is not higher enough.

9. First, a mixture of iron, limestone and coke is put in the blast furnance. Hot air is blasted into the furnance, oxygen reacts with coke to form carbon
   monoxide, which is a reducing agent. Carbon monoxide then removes the oxygen in iron (III) oxide, producing iron metal. Limestone helps removes unwanted 
   impurities, like silica/silicon dioxide. Calcium oxide forms calcium silicate upon reacting with silica and is removed as molten slag.

10. Molten slag is a by-product during the separation of molten steel. It can used for building materials.

11. Lead is poisonous and volatile.

12. Lead (II) sulphide is burnt in air and reacts with oxygen to form lead (II) oxide. Then, lead (II) oxide is burnt with carbon, which produces lead metal 
    and carbon dioxide.

13. Reduce metal articles, recycling used metals, and reducing the use of metal,

14. The separation of metal in metal waste is difficult and time-consuming. Besides, the cost of melting and purifying the metal is high in HK.

15. Recycling saves energy and metal resources, and it helps reduce pollution.

16. The metals may exist as a free element in nature, or the extraction method is simple due to its low reactivity.

17. It is because magnesium is very oxide and forms the most stbale oxide.

Chapter 11

1. Reactivity is the readiness to react.

2. The higher the rate of reaction, the more reactive the metal. The lower the temperature needed to start the reactio, the more reactive the metal. The more
   energy is released in the reaction, the more reactive the metal.

3. metal + oxygen --> metal oxide (only for mercury or above, burns for iron or above)
   metal + water --> metal hydroxide + hydrogen gas (only for calcium or above)
   metal + steam --> metal oxide + hydrogen gas (only for iron or above)
   metal + dilute acid --> metal salt + hydrogen gas (only for lead or above)

4. The metal reacts with oxygen in the air. An oxide layer is formed on the surface of the metal.

5. We shold store it under paraffin oil (potassium + sodium) or in an airtight container (calcium).

6. 

7. 

8. Calcium hydroxide is formed during the reaction between calcium and water. It appears as milky suspension because it is only slightly soluble in water.

9a) Aluminium metal is usually covered with a very thin layer of aluminium oxide. The oxide layer prevents the metal from further reaction.

9b) Lead (II) chloride is insoluble in water, which covers the surface of the lead metal and stop further reaction.

10. potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, zinc, iron, lead, copper, mercury, silver, gold

11. Calcium has one more electron in the 4th electron shell than potassium. The nucleus of calcium contains one more protin than potassium. Therefore, there
    is a higher attractive force on the electron towards the nucleus in calcium.

12. There are more electrons in the outermost electron shell of an element across the period. More energy is required to lose the electron.

13. The distance between the nucleus and the outermost shell electrons increase down a group because it has more electron shells. The attractive forces between
    the nucleus and the outermost shell electrons becomes weaker, and the valence electrons are easily lost.

14. 

15. Zinc metal dissolves to form a colourless soluion. Reddish brown solid is formed on the zinc surface. The solution turns from blue to colourless.

16.

17.

18. Calcium reacts with sulphuric acid to form insoluible calcium sulphate on its surface which stops the reaction.

19. We can compare the vigour fo reactions by the energy released in the reaction. The hotter the solution the more reactive the metal.

20. No, because sodium is too reactive. It reacts with water in the solution, forms hydrogen gas, and results in an explosive reaction.

21a) Add magnesium to copper (II) chloride solution. Magnesium displaces copper copper (II) chloride to form magnesium (II) chloride and copper metal.

21b) No, because calcium reacts with water to form hydrogen gas. 

22. Sodium metal to form a silvery ball, floats and moves around quickly on the water surface, burns with a golden yellow flame, 
    and dissolves to form a colourless solution.

23a) Add a piece of magnesium to both solutions. There is no reaction and observable change between magnesium and the magnesium sulphate solution. However,
     magnesium dissolves in zinc sulphate solution to form a colourless solution and a black solid.

23b) No, because aluminium is usually coated with a thin layer of aluminium oxide, which prevents the metal from reacting with other metal sulphate in aqueous
     solution. Fresh aluminium needs to be used, but it is very diffficult to extract in the laboratory as it is reactive with oxygen.

24. The mixture glows, and it burns with a bluish green flame upon heating. Yellow solid (zinc oxide) is observed. When the mixture cools down, some white solid
    and reddish brown solid is seen.
